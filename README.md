This is the official implementation of "Generalizable Backdoor Detection and Removal Framework: From Dataset Perspective"

Here is the core code of our method. At the same time, we are organizing the entire project code, and we will make all the code public after the paper is accepted.

For double-blind reviewing, we have carefully reviewed our code and removed all potential sensitive information, such as file paths and other content that may compromise privacy!
